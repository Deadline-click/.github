> A living archive of stories that outlive their headlines. We track news after the world moves on.

**What happens after the world stops watching?**

## The Way Things Are

A tragedy breaks. Everyone talks about it. Promises are made. 

Then a new story comes. And another. And another.

The old story? Still happening. Still unresolved. Just invisible now.

## What We Do Here

We keep the record open.

When the headlines move on, we stay. When the updates stop trending, we log them anyway. When no one is counting anymore, we count.

This is just a timeline. A simple log. Nothing more. But sometimes that's everything.

## How This Works

We use AI to scan news and track stories over time. It finds updates. It connects events. It builds timelines.

The AI doesn't write anything. It just helps us see patterns and keep things organized. Every story links back to its source. Real journalists. Real reporting. We just make sure it doesn't disappear.

**One thing to know**: AI isn't perfect. It misses things. It makes mistakes. That's why sources matter. Check them. Think for yourself.

## The Honest Part

We're just 2 people doing this because it feels necessary. No company behind us. No ads. No agenda.

**If you find this useful, consider helping.** Whatever you can give keeps the servers running and the lights on.

## Help Us Get Better

Something looks wrong? Let us know.

Want to contribute? We'd love that.
